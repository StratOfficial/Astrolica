I am very proud to announce that Astrolica is now open to the public for pre-alpha testing.

I've been very hard at work for months developing some awesome features and I believe it's ready for public release, however please be aware that this is a pre-alpha so what's available is either not fully complete or still in development and bugs and glitches are very possible.

I have decided to release this to keep track of bugs and take suggestions and even ideas, if you find a bug or just have a suggestion please let me know in the discussions section.

I have also begun releasing dev builds which usually contain very early code and dev textures, most things added in these versions will lack functionality or work differently in pre-alpha release.

Thank you and have fun!
