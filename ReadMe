I am very proud to announce that Astrolica is now open to the public for pre-alpha testing.

We've been very hard at work for months developing some awesome features and we believe it's ready for public release, however please be aware that this is a pre-alpha so what's available is either not fully complete or still in development and bugs and glitches are very possible.

We have decided to release this to help us track bugs and take suggestions and even ideas, if you find a bug or just have a suggestion please let us know in the discussions section.

We have also begun releasing dev builds which usually contain very early code and dev textures, most things added in these versions will lack functionality or work differently in pre-alpha release.

Thank you and have fun!
